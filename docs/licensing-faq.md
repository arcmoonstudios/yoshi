# Licensing FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Business Source License?

It blocks production/commercial deployment while letting the community play,
learn and contribute.  After 48 months everybody gets GPL freedoms.

### Can I use Yoshi in an open-source project?

Yes, provided the project itself is non-commercial / non-production or you
obtain a commercial license.

### Is "internal" use commercial?

Yes.  If the software powers revenue-generating business processes it is
commercial/production use.

### How do I buy a license?

Email <LordXyn@proton.me> or sign the Commercial License Agreement in
`contracts/COMMERCIAL-LICENSE-AGREEMENT.md`.

### Will you ever switch to MIT?

No.  The Change License is GPL v3.  Commercial users can always purchase
a proprietary license instead.
