## [0.1.7] - 2025-06-05

### 🔧 **Bug Fixes & Compilation Issues**

#### ✅ **Resolved Unused Variable Warnings**

- **Fixed unused variable warnings in Oops enum**: Resolved compiler warnings for `status_code`, `endpoint`, and `reason` fields in the `yoshi_af!` macro-generated enum
  - **Root cause**: The `#[yoshi(display = "...")]` attributes correctly used the fields, but the compiler was not recognizing their usage within the procedural macro expansion
  - **Solution**: Proper field usage pattern established in the `yoshi_af!` macro implementation
  - **Impact**: Clean compilation with zero warnings across the entire workspace
  - **Performance**: No runtime impact - purely compile-time warning resolution
